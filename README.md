Navigation Bar Project: 
This consists of presenting a web navigation bar that is highlighted by the mousehover effect on each menu item. 
It should be noted that for this project the CSS Framework was used: Bootstrap 5, which is very useful when it 
comes to developing web projects that require a typography that complements the project.
